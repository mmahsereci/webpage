**Emulation of physical processes with Emukit**<br>
Decision making in uncertain scenarios is an ubiquitous challenge in real world
systems. Tools to deal with this challenge include simulations to gather information
and statistical emulation to quantify uncertainty. The machine learning community
has developed a number of methods to facilitate decision making, but so far they
are scattered in multiple different toolkits, and generally rely on a fixed backend.
In this paper, we present Emukit, a highly adaptable Python toolkit for enriching
decision making under uncertainty. Emukit allows users to: (i) use state of the art
methods including Bayesian optimization, multi-fidelity emulation, experimental
design, Bayesian quadrature and sensitivity analysis; (ii) easily prototype new
decision making methods for new problems. Emukit is agnostic to the
modeling framework and enables users to use their own custom models.
