            <b>Emulation of physical processes with Emukit</b>
            <br>
            Decision making in uncertain scenarios is an ubiquitous challenge in real world
            systems. Tools to deal with this challenge include simulations to gather information
            and statistical emulation to quantify uncertainty. The machine learning community
            has developed a number of methods to facilitate decision making, but so far they
            are scattered in multiple different toolkits, and generally rely on a fixed backend.
            In this paper, we present Emukit, a highly adaptable Python toolkit for enriching
            decision making under uncertainty. Emukit allows users to: (i) use state of the art
            methods including Bayesian optimization, multi-fidelity emulation, experimental
            design, Bayesian quadrature and sensitivity analysis; (ii) easily prototype new
            decision making methods for new problems. Emukit is agnostic to the
            modeling framework and enables users to use their own custom models.
