    <b>On Acquisition Functions for Active Multi-Source Bayesian Quadrature</b>
    <br>
    Bayesian quadrature (BQ) is the method of choice for solving integrals of
    expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. Active learning schemes so far
    only focus on the integrand itself, and do not allow for incorporation of
    cheaper, related information sources. Here, we set the scene for active
    learning in Bayesian quadrature when multiple related information sources
    of variable cost in input and source are accessible. In standard BQ
    the same active learning scheme is induced by several measures of gain on
    the integral estimation. We show that this degeneracy is lifted in the multi-
    source setting, in which the previously interchangeably used standard BQ utilities
    yield different active learning schemes.
